            <p>Hello, this is Jessica!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am a certified Life & Career Coach, specialized in Expats.</p>
            <p>In a nutshell, I help those living outside their home country shape their experience abroad and make the
                most of it, both personally and professionally.</p>
            <br>
            <!-- <p>You might be wondering how I ended up here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Coaching got to my life in a moment where I was feeling completely lost for the first time ever.</p>
                <p>I apparently had it all.</p>
                <p>A shiny and bursty career as a Hotel Manager.</p>
                <p>Living on one of the most beautiful islands in the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>But I felt that something was off.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My best friend suggested me a coach.</p>
                <p>I honestly had no idea what to expect from that session but from that moment everything changed.</p>
                <p>I got to know myself much better [and love me even more].</p>
                <p>I landed the job of my dreams.</p>
                <p>I met THE one.</p>
                <p>I remember thinking "Wow, this coaching thing is really powerful! I want to help other people to experience the same"</p>
                <br>
                <p>And here I am, several trainings and certifications later, to support you in this journey.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Wondering if we might be the perfect match to work on your life and/or career?</p> -->
