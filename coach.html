            <p class="br">Change may seem uncomfortable and risky.
                But how uncomfortable is it to stay in the same situation that is dragging you down emotionally and
                mentally and not letting you progress in your career?</p>

            <p class="br">My name is Jessica Morari and I am a certified Life & Career Coach, specialized in Expats.
                Since 2015 I have been mentoring and coaching international talents to build their best career abroad
                and thriving at it, as Hotel Manager first, and as a Certified Coach then.
                My method will give you the key to gain clarity, improve your mindset and take action to finally get
                what you deserve.</p>
