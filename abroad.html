            <p>I feel you. I have been there myself.</p>
            <p>There was a time when I felt that I was going through life without really living it. Until the point
                where I
                thought about giving it all up and stop chasing my dreams.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Through coaching, lots of questions and actions, I was finally able to revolution my life and create my
                best
                reality in every aspect.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since then, I have been on the go around the world designing the life and the career that I have always
                dreamt about.</p>
            <p>Today with "Thriving Abroad", I help expats who are willing to STOP to giving up on life and say YES to
                the
                life and career of their dreams.</p>

        <p class="life2">That's why I designed "Thriving Abroad", a 12-week journey based on 6 pillars that are the key
            to get that more and better that we all dream of.
