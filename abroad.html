        <h2>IS LIFE HAPPENING TO YOU?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>- You feel like you were meant for more and better</p>
        <br>
        <p>- You feel alone and disconnected from the people around you</p>
        <br>
        <p>- You struggle to organize your life and create routines that support your physical, mental and emotional
            wellbeing</p>
        <br>
        <p>- You lack energy, motivation and purpose</p>
        <br>
        <p>- You feel lost and don't know where to start</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>If any of these resonate with you, it might be worth it having a chat...</p>
        <br>
        <p>I feel you. I have been there myself.</p>
        <p>There was a time when I felt that I was going through life without really living it. Until the point where I
            thought about giving it all up and stop chasing my dreams.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Through coaching, lots of questions and actions, I was finally able to revolution my life and create my best
            reality in every aspect.</p>
            <br>
        <p>Since then, I have been on the go around the world designing the life and the career that I have always
            dreamt about.</p>
        <p>Today with "Thriving Abroad", I help expats who are willing to STOP to giving up on life and say YES to the
            life and career of their dreams.</p>
