                <p>My name is Jessica Morari and I am a Certified Life & Career Coach specialized in Expats.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Originally from Milan, I moved to Spain in 2015 to pursue my career as a Hotel Manager.</p>
                <p>I found myself thousands of km aways from my family and lifelong friends, working 70+ hours per week
                    and living a long-distance relationship.</p>
                <p>I felt that I was surviving instead of living my life as if I meant it.</p>
                <p>I felt that I was surviving instead of thriving.</p>
                <p>I knew I had to do something.</p>
                <p>Out of desperation, I attended a coaching session.</p>
                <p>I honestly didn't even really knew what coaching was back then. But from that moment everything
                    changed.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Since then, I have been on the go around the world designing the life and the career that I have
                    always dreamt about.</p>
                <p>And here I am to help you do the same: go from surviving to thriving, in life and work living abroad.
